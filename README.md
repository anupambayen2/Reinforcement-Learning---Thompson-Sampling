Project Summary: Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning classification techniques to detect whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on clinical features. It is part of my daily GitHub uploads to practice and strengthen machine learning concepts using real-world datasets.

📌 Objective

To build an accurate classification model that assists in early detection of breast cancer, helping improve diagnosis and patient outcomes.

📊 Dataset

Dataset used: breast_cancer.csv

Contains multiple numerical features extracted from breast tumor cell images

Target variable:

Diagnosis (0 = Benign, 1 = Malignant)

This dataset is commonly used for medical classification problems.

🛠️ Steps Performed

Loaded and explored the dataset

Performed data preprocessing and feature selection

Split data into training and testing sets

Trained a machine learning classification model

Evaluated performance using:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, and F1-score

📈 Key Insight

Certain tumor characteristics strongly influence malignancy prediction.

The model achieves high accuracy and recall, which is crucial in medical diagnosis.

Minimizing false negatives is especially important to avoid missing cancer cases.

🧪 Outputs

Cancer type predictions

Confusion matrix

Model performance metrics

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can support medical diagnosis by identifying patterns in clinical data. Breast cancer detection is a critical real-world application where accurate and reliable models can have a meaningful impact.
